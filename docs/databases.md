# Databases

To add a new database, an Admin needs to go to the **Advanced page**.

When you add a database, give it a clear and memorable name like "Business Data" or "Client Records." This name will be used to identify your database later on.

You'll also need to provide a **Connection String**. This is special information that tells our system how to connect to your database. Because connection strings often contain sensitive details, we only show your chosen database's name, not the full connection string, once it's set up.

We currently support the following database types:
*   MySQL (and MariaDB)
*   PostgreSQL
*   Microsoft SQL Server
*   SQLite

For help with creating your connection string, you can check out this helpful resource: [ConnectionStrings.com](https://www.connectionstrings.com/).
